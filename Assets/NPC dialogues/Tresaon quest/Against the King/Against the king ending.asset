  answer: I am glad to see that we have the same opinion about the King. Before I
    tell you more, I must speak with my comrade. I will come back to you as soon
    as I can. In the meantime, go and see Theodore, he is near the blacksmith. He
    will give you the gold coins, you have well deserved them. Farewell my friend.
